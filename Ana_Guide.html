            <b>Ana</b> is a high skill-cap, dragonblade sleeping, AOE heal denying, blue-juice super steroid dosing grandma badass, focused around the utilization of her dangerous arsenal to both watch over her allies and shutdown enemies, all with the precision of a well-seasoned sniper.

            <em>"Experience always wins in the end."</em> Ana is both a very mechanically and mentally demanding hero, forcing you to constantly keep on your toes, and be ready for any situation. Ana is not a reactionary-based character. The best Anas can predict the actions of their enemies, and punish their predictability through raw game sense. Becoming an dangerous Ana is no easy journey, and there will most certainly be moments of absolute failure, where your level of incompetence <b>CAN</b> and <b>WILL</b> cost you the game. The key is to just keep moving forward and <b>LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES</b>. If you're adamant on taking on the responsibility of wielding one of the most high impact characters in the game, look no further.

        <h1> <u>Abilities</u></h1>

        <p>
            <b><u>Biotic Rifle:</u></b>
            <br>
            Ana's rifle shoots darts that can heal her allies or damage enemies. She can scope in with the rifle to make her shots hitscan.
        </p>
            <em><b>Details:</b></em>
            <ul>
                <li> Biotic Rifle <b>heals for 75 hp</b>, <b>damages for 70 hp</b> per shot, and cannot headshot.</li>
                <li>Unscoped shots are <b>projectile</b>. Scoped shots are <b>hitscan</b>, but leaves a <b>bullet trail</b>.</li>
                <li>Your shots <b>will pass through full health allies.</b></li>  
                <li> Shots can be blocked by barriers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Aiming Technique</u></h2> 
        
        <p> 

        <b>AIM. YOUR. SHOTS.</b> No, really... It's that simple. Many new ana players, especially those new to FPS games, often get into the bad habit of rushing their shots. Focus on landing the shots first. Speed with come with time and practice. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually increase your speed.        
        </p>
    <p>
        <b>RELAX. Take it easy.</b> A bad habit that affects primary inexperienced FPS players attempting to aim while under pressure is <b>panic-aiming. </b><em><u>(Panic-aiming is when a player's aim becomes too overly shaky to reliably land any shots, resulting in many easy shots being made difficult, and hard shots near impossible to land due to overflicking/wobbly crosshair placement).</u></em> Panic-aiming is a very difficult habit to break initially, but <b>it is vital that you break this bad habit</b> before drags your consistency down the drain. 
        <br>
        <br>
      When you're panic-aiming, you aren't focsed on accuracy. You're playing on the false hope that by some miracle, you manage to kill them first. Luck won't carry you very far. <em><b>This is the primary reason as to why people think they can't, or never will be able to aim.</b></em><u> This doesn't mean get lazy/sluggish with your aim.</u> Just try to stay calm despite the heat of the moment. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Reloading</h3>
        
        <p><em><u>Only reload when no one is in/will be in imminent danger.</u></em> This is one of the most common errors among Ana players. Stop reloading so often. Use every shot in your clip until the fight is over. </p>
        
        <h3>Healing v Damaging</h3>
        <p>
        This concept is key to playing Ana. As a support, your job is to keep your team alive, and enhance their capabilities/effectiveness in any way you can, while impeding the enemy's ability to do their jobs as effectively. It should be noted that healing always takes priority over dealing damage.
            <br>
        First, what needs to be established is about healing who needs it the most. Here is a standard hierachy when it comes to priority. <em> Do please note that circumstances change these priorities all the time, and that there are too many scenarios to list.</em>
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Anyone at <u>critical health</u> who is in <b> IMMINENT DANGER/FIGHTING.</b></li>
            <li>Anyone who is in <b>IMMINENT DANGER/FIGHTING.</b></li>
            <li>Supports/Allies with team winning ultimates<em>(Graviton Surge, Earthshatter, Transcendance, etc.)</em></li>
            <li>Tanks</li>
            <li>DPS</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Now that it's been established who you are generally going to be prioritizing your healing on, next is balancing the healing in with damage. It's quite simple. <u>If no one is in imminent danger/you aren't currently healing anyone, <b>SHOOT AT YOUR OPPONENT.</b></u> Farming your ultimate as a support is extremely important. You need to fight for every bit of ult-charge you can get your hands on. 
        </p>

        <p>

        <b><u>Sleep Dart:</u></b> 
        <br>    
        Ana fires a dart from her sidearm, rendering enemies unconscious for 5.5 seconds. Any damage taken within 4.5 seconds of the effect will wake the target up,<b> HOWEVER,</b> if the target is woken up during the last second of the sleep dart, the target will take .5 seconds to fully wake back up.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Landing Sleep Darts</h4>
        <p> Sleep dart is certainly one of the more challenging abilities to land in the game. The key to landing more sleep darts is to have a plan of how you're going to use it.
        <br>
        For instance, if you know know that the enemy roadhog has Whole Hog ready, it is less likely that you will miss if you can anticipate the use of it. The same thing goes for any channeled ultimate such as barrage, death blossom, etc. 
        <br>
        The harder sleeps are the defensive ones that ARE reactionary, that simply rely on your mechanical ability. The simplest way to put it into words is to read your opponenets movement. Genji, for example, can be a nuissance to kill because of all of his mobility. You want to sleep him when he is in a vunerable animation. <em><u>(When he's at the arc of his double jump, when he's wall-climbing, when you've baited him into a small room/corridor, etc.) </u></em>
        HOWEVER, if you have no time to waste and don't have the time to read your opponents movement, you really just have to get a feel for how much you need to flick your crosshair, which only comes through practice. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>How to use Sleep Dart</h4>
        <p>
        When it comes to the usage of sleep dart, you need to ask yourself 3 very important questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Will I save someone/myself?</li>
            <li>Will I kill someone?/Take someone important out of the fight?</li>
            <li>Will I need this sleep dart later/Will I be punished for using this sleep dart?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
        <b>The ideal time to use sleep dart is if the answer question 1 or 2 is YES, AND the answer to question 3 is NO. Don't waste your sleep dart. This ability is too important to just toss across the map.</b> It should also be noted that should you sleep an enemy, <u>TELL YOUR TEAM.</u> Your team needs to know someone is slept to make sure that 1) they don't wake up the sleeping target, and/or 2) they know where to sleeping target is for them to kill.
        </p>

        <br>
        <b><u>Biotic Grenade:</u></b>
        <br>
         Ana tosses a biotic explosive that deals damage to enemies, and heals allies in a 4m splash radius, dealing 60 damage to enemies, and 100 healing to self and allies. Allies affected + self recieve a 50% increase in healing from all sources, while enemies cannot be healed. Duration is 4 seconds. 
        
        </p>
        
        <h3>How to use Biotic Grenade</h3>
        <p>
            Biotic Grenade, also called "Nade", or "BioNade", which is what it will be referred to from now on, is an extremely powerful ability that can single handed end teamfights. Knowing how to use BioNade relies on quickly assessing opportunities presented during a teamfight. Note that <em><u>it is much more important to focus on denying healing from the enemy team than to heal your team with nade unless multiple allies are critical.</u></em> If multiple allies are critical, nade your tanks to quickly burst heal them into armor range or at least above half hp, while throwing 1 or 2 shots into your squishier allies. 
            <br>
            Ideally, you want to hit both your team and the enemy team, but this isn't always possible. Every teamfight, if possible, try to nade the enemy tanks, especially the main tank, to give your team an openning to aggress onto the enemy team. A helpful tip is if the enemy team is walking through a choke or is against a wall, you can through the nade above the shield and onto the wall to let the splash of the Nade hit everyone behind the shield.
            <br>
            <br>
            SPEAKING OF WHICH, this brings us to our next point, which is that you should only nade <u>when your team is actually close enough to follow up off of the BioNade.</u> Same concept as the sleep dart. Don't just chunk it across the map and hope it hits someone. Your abilities' cooldowns are too high to waste, meaning you must guaruntee you get value out of your abilities. This also includes using your nade to heal yourself. Let your other healer do that unless you have literally no other choice.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Every macro-decision you make as Ana must be made methodically.</em>

        <p>
        <b><u>Nano Boost (Ultimate):</u></b>
        <br>
        Ana fires a special dart into an ally, instantly healing them for 300 hp, along with 50% more damage and 50% damage reduction for 8 seconds.  The tricky part about using Nano Boost is deiciding who to cast it on and when to use it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Chosing who to nano boost is very situational, but generally, your nano boost target is dependant on what action will give you the most value, and whether or not the nano boosted target can actually do much with the nano boost. 
        <br>
        For instance, if your Genji has dragonblade, giving your Genji the nano boost during the fight, or even to initate the fight, will likely give your team highest possible. <em>Let's go over when to nano boost each type of hero.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Nano Boosting Tanks:</h3>
        
        <p>Usually, the only times you ever nano boost tanks are to keep them alive to contest point, or if multiple allies are critical and the nano is being used as a means of buying time to heal the rest of your allies. <em>There are three main exceptions to this rule however: </em><b>Nano boosting Zarya, Reinhardt, and Winston</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Zarya:</u></b> Nano boosting a high-charge Zarya not only gives you a cool light-show, but also allows zarya to build her graviton extremely quickly, and turns her into a human microwave. Zaryas can build 35%-50% of their entire graviton by just being nano boosted and getting to melt down enemy tanks with a high charged beam. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Winston:</u></b> Nano boosting a Winston is almost as scary for an immobile backline as a dragonblading Genji. Not only can Winston rapidly close the distance onto his desired target, but his weapon is semi lock-on, and turns his little electric feather duster into a mobile lightning rod. Not to mention he's so tanky, it's very, very, unlikley he will die anytime soon without a major group effort from the enemy team. It would take an obscene amount of healing to keep a backline alive against an arcing 90dps onto multiple clumped up enemies.
            
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Reinhardt:</u></b>
        It's extremely common to see Ana's slap their Nano boost onto a Reinhardt and expect him wipe the enemy team, only to be surprised when he doesn't. It's important to remember that Reinhardt is a fully melee based character. The best time to Nano boost a Reinhardt is when he's already swinging at the enemy team and starting to get a little low, using the Reinhardt as bait to get them to over-commit onto your Reinhardt. This also charges his ultimate very fast.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Nano Boosting Damage Characters:</h3>
        
        <p>
        Not all nano boost targets were made equal, and this is especially apparant in the damage category. Generally, you want to combo Nano boost with ultimates when the usage of their ultimate is not enough to kill the enemy team. This is usually more relevant when the enemy team has support ultimates. For instance, dragonblade cannot kill through transcendance, but Nano-blade can. Barrage can kill squishy enemies quite quickly, but often results in pharah dying before she can secure too many kills. When nano boosted, she is not only more likely to survive the entire barrage, but will also kill her targets that much faster.
        
    <br>
    <br>
        Since quite a few DPS can be decent nano boost targets, <u>here is a list of DPS who</u>, despite how entertaining it may be to watch, <u>are objectivly poor nano boost targets</u>:
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Widowmaker</li>
        <li>Ashe (Instead of B.O.B)</li>
        <li>Junkrat</li>
        <li>Sombra</li>
        <li>Hanzo</li>
        <li>McCree</li>
        <li>Mei</li> 
    </ul>
        <p>
        Every character put in this list is considered a bad nano boost target because they lack the consistency of damage to utilize the damage aimplifyer of the nano boost, or its too situational to justify its use.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Nano Boosting Supports:</h3>
        <p>
        As crazy as it may sound, there are justifiable reasons for nano boosting a support. Generally, the only reason you would nano boost a support is if they have an ultimate too valuable to risk letting them die, and need peeling ASAP. Generally, there are only 2 supports you will ever nano boost a majority of the time. <b>Brigitte and Zenyatta</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Brigitte:</u></b> Brigitte's rally can drastically increase the tankiness of your entire team, yet ironically enough, her death can significantly reduce it. Nano boosting a brigitte is very effective at detering divers. Brigitte is already frustrating enough for many dive characters to duel with how tanky she is, and the surprising amount of damage she can output. With a nano boost, she becomes almost impossible for any one hero to duel, sometimes even two or three heroes to kill, especially if you're still healing her, or if she is naded by you.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b><u>Zenyatta:</u></b> Zenyatta transcendance is arguably the best support ultimate in the game due to its versatility and reliability as a defensive ultimate. It's not completely unreasonable to nano boost a zenyatta who is being dove who is close to transcendance. Though this isn't a super common strategy, nor are there too many scenarios in which this is the optimal play to be made, but its definely not worth ruling out, especially if the game is approaching overtime.
        </p>

        <h1><u>Positioning</u></h1>
        
        <p>
        Positioning is, BY FAR, the most important skill of an aspiring Ana player. It is the very foundation of your gameplay, and the most common error of many new and experienced Anas alike. Positioning is very dynamic, but with very specific caveats, requiring the player to conciously recognize good positioning and correct bad positioning on the fly. Perfect positioning is not achievable, because every position has its advantages and disadvantages. However, optimizing your positioning is the goal. <b>Here are some simple guidelines for positioning with Ana: </b>
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li> Make sure you can reach cover or a healthpack within 1-2 seconds if you were to start getting shot at or dove. Standing near corners to peekshoot can help make this easier.</li>
            <li>Let your tanks stand on the objective. It is very, very rare that you, as an Ana, will be on the objective contesting. Let your tanks do that.</li>
            <li>Try not to stand directly behind your team. You always want to stand slightly off to the side of your team to prevent your shots from being blocked, and to make it easier for you to land your abilities on the right target.</li>
            <li> High ground is preferable, but make sure the position you take on high ground gives you a good angle to oversee the objective, your teammates, and the enemy. Some high ground angles will give you too awkward of an angle to shoot from like shooting directly downwards. That's when you know to need reposition.</li>
            <li> Ideally, you want to be in areas where the enemy cannot attack you without you knowing.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Heroes That Drastically Alter Your Positioning:</h3>
    
        <p>
        <b><u>Pharah:</u></b> Pharah's ability to rain hell on you from above can make it significantly harder for you to heal your allies, and although you can take out a Pharah if she's not being pocketed, a decent Pharah isn't going to make that such a simple task. When against a Pharah, you often want to position yourself in roofed areas so she is forced to take a more risky angle if she wants to attack you. This makes her an easier target for you and your allies to shoot, and potentially sleep dart. If you're being attacked by a Pharah, find an indoor cover ASAP, and tell your team you're being pursued by a Pharah.
        <br>
            <br>
        
        <b><u>Dive Heroes (Genji, Tracer, Winston, etc.):</u></b> Dealing with being dove is often a challenge, but nothing a little wit and smart positioning can't fix. When it comes to dive heroes, it's not just where you position, but also where you reposition as you get dove. The worst thing you can do is split yourself off from your team. 
            <br>
            <br>
         With that being said, when you're playing against a dive compositon, you generally want to be positioned in areas that force the dive team to use their mobility to reach you, and where you have a healthpack nearby. However, when you are retreating, you <b>ALWAYS</b> want to retreat to position where your team can peel for you, which is really map and team comp depedant, but generally you want to retreat to your off tank, your other support, or DPS and communicate for them to peel for you. <b><u>D.Va, Torbjorn, Brigitte, Lucio, McCree, Soldier 76, and Zarya</u></b> are especially helpful when it comes to peeling because they have significant enough damage to deter/kill the dive team and/or they have very strong defensive options to protect you from the dive. If you are expecting a dive, staying near one of these heroes can become paramount to your survival the better the enemy dive team is.
        <br>
            <br>
        <b><u>Snipers(Widowmaker, Hanzo, and Ashe):</u></b> Even though Ana herself is a sniper, you should never consider it a good idea to attempt to duel an enemy sniper. It takes you 3 shots to kill them, where as it only takes them 1 clean headshot (Or 1 headshot + 1 bodyshot in Ashe isn't being pocketed) to send your butt back to the spawn room. Especially as you climb, you're going to run into snipers that aren't going to miss many easy shots. Even if you're against a widow that is aiming at the floor and still missing, they will, EVENTUALLY, land a shot on you, and you'll cost your team the upcoming fight.
            <br>
            <br>
            Against a sniper, it is key that you keep track of their position as often as you can. You need to ensure you are out of their sightline at all times. Sticking close to walls and corners can drastically help prevent them from being able to attack you. Be wary of flanking snipers however. Especially on maps such as Rialto, Junkertown, and Dorado where multiple flank routes with wide open sightlines exist, it's not uncommon for a Hanzo or Widow to attempt to attack you from behind. Staying in roofed areas with windows may also help, as, once again, they usually have to take more risky, or in this case predictable angles in order to attack you.
